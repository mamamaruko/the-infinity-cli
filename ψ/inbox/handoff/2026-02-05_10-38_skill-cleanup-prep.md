# Handoff: Skill Cleanup Prep

**Date**: 2026-02-05 10:38
**Context**: Post /learn, /trace, /rrr fixes - ready to clean up skills

## What We Did

This session (v1.5.55 → v1.5.63):

1. **Fixed /learn subagent bug** - Subagents were writing to wrong location (inside origin/ symlink)
   - Key fix: Pass literal absolute paths, not variables
   - Added date folders + time-prefixed files (YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM_*.md)

2. **Aligned /trace** with /learn structure
   - Removed broken symlink creation
   - Added `--repo [path|url]` flag
   - Trace logs to `ψ/memory/traces/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMM_*.md`

3. **Added /rrr --deep** with 5 parallel agents
   - Git deep dive, file changes, timeline, patterns, Oracle memory

4. **Discovered skill frontmatter options**
   - `user-invocable: false` - hides from `/` menu
   - `disable-model-invocation: true` - prevents Claude auto-invoke

## Pending

- [ ] Document skill visibility frontmatter in /skill-creator
- [ ] Add frontmatter reference to MEMORY.md
- [ ] Test /learn --deep on another repo

## Next Session: Skill Cleanup

User requested: "next session we will cleanup some our skills!"

- [ ] Review all 27 skills for consistency
- [ ] Apply date/time folder patterns where applicable
- [ ] Add `user-invocable: false` to background-only skills
- [ ] Update skill descriptions for better trigger words
- [ ] Consider consolidating similar skills
- [ ] **Fix /forward** - Should auto-enter plan mode but didn't!

## Key Files

- `src/skills/learn/SKILL.md` - Reference for date/time structure
- `src/skills/trace/SKILL.md` - Reference for --repo flag pattern
- `src/skills/rrr/SKILL.md` - Reference for --deep mode
